"""Block cpuidle states too slow for the HCI UART to survive (issue #120).

On i.MX Kindles the deepest cpuidle state (LOW-POWER-IDLE: ARM platform off,
24 MHz OSC, DDR in self-refresh) has an exit latency far longer than the UART
RX FIFO can buffer at 2 Mbaud. If the Broadcom chip transmits while the SoC is
that deep, the leading bytes are gone before the UART is clocked again. We also
disable bluesleep to keep the chip awake, which tears down the HOST_WAKE IRQ,
so nothing wakes the SoC ahead of the data.

Preferred mechanism is a PM QoS CPU_DMA_LATENCY request: the constraint lives
as long as the fd is open, so it releases on crash and survives suspend with no
bookkeeping. Falls back to the per-state sysfs disable flag where the misc
device is missing, saving and restoring the original values.
